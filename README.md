# melomaniac
A music-based community that provides buying power for high-value limited quantity items through attestation of music fandom.

The music industry often faces the problem of scalpers who take advantage of high-value collectible items, such as concert tickets. This causes super fans or "Melomaniacs" to purchase tickets from secondary markets. Artists have attempted to eliminate secondary markets through various solutions, including posting generic presale codes on social media, allocating tickets through a lottery system, and sending presale codes through fanbase newsletters. Unfortunately, these solutions are easily exploited by scalpers.

Melomaniac offers an innovative solution by identifying genuine fans from scalpers through a centralized data aggregation platform. By leveraging web 2 APIs from popular music services like Spotify, Soundcloud, Ticketmaster, and AXS, Melomaniac assigns a Customer Lifetime value to each fan for each artist. The higher the attestation for true fandom, the more buying power each individual has. Presale codes are allocated only to the most authentic fans, limiting to two per presale order. Moreover, there are restrictions on the number of times a presale code can be resold with price markups, ensuring the artists and the platform take a cut on every transfer.

Fans can build their Melomaniac credit score by frequently attending concerts, sharing on social media, or referring friends to the platform. These points can be redeemed for presales, discounts on future ticket purchases, exclusive merchandise, or other perks. Additionally, artists can incentivize fans by creating challenges or competitions around ticket purchases. For instance, they could make a leaderboard for fans who purchase the most tickets or offer prizes for those who buy tickets for multiple events in a specific timeframe.

Melomaniac also allows individuals who have never attended an artist's live show to increase their interactions on music platforms like Spotify, Soundcloud, and Instagram, creating a marketing campaign for the artists and boosting interactions across multiple platforms. As a result, every fan now becomes a promoter.

In summary, Melomaniac is an innovative solution that aims to work alongside current web 2 and web 3 ticketing platforms, providing data and value to artists instead of competing in the oversaturated ticketing space.
